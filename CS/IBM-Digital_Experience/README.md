# IBM Digital Experience

Course offered by Banco Santander and IBM in the program of scholarships "Becas Santander". This was an introductory course to several topics, as Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Design Thinking and IBM Watson.

*summary.pdf* is a summary of the course and *watson_sample.json* is a simple json script that defines the behavior of Watson for a fictional restaurant.

This course was a dissapointment, I expected much more for it due to the name and standards of IBM, but it was not so good.
